                    <hr>
                    <p>WINNERS OF STARTUP WEEKEND SHEFFIELD (2019), 721 (seven continents into one) is born out of frustration and lack of tools available to cure our desire for new experiences in OUR local areas and also when we travel. We refuse to waste any more time looking for experiences that should be easily and effortlessly accessible. We are a driven team of entrepreneurs (Adiam, Alex and Bhav) who have a passion for creating something new, and inspired by new experiences that fuel who we are.</p>
